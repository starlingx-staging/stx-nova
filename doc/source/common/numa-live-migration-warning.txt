   In deployments older than Stein, or in mixed Rocky/Stein deployments with a
   rolling upgrade in progress, unless :oslo.config:option:`specifically
   enabled <workarounds.enable_numa_live_migration>`, live migration is not
   currently possible for instances with a NUMA topology when using the libvirt
   driver. A NUMA topology may be specified explicitly or can be added
   implicitly due to the use of CPU pinning or huge pages. Refer to `bug
   #1289064`__ for more information.
