Specific cache modes to use for different disk types.

For example: file=directsync,block=none,network=writeback

For local or direct-attached storage, it is recommended that you use
writethrough (default) mode, as it ensures data integrity and has acceptable
I/O performance for applications running in the guest, especially for read
operations. However, caching mode none is recommended for remote NFS storage,
because direct I/O operations (O_DIRECT) perform better than synchronous I/O
operations (with O_SYNC). Caching mode none effectively turns all guest I/O
operations into direct I/O operations on the host, which is the NFS client in
this environment.

Possible cache modes:

* default: Same as writethrough.
* none: With caching mode set to none, the host page cache is disabled, but
  the disk write cache is enabled for the guest. In this mode, the write
  performance in the guest is optimal because write operations bypass the host
  page cache and go directly to the disk write cache. If the disk write cache
  is battery-backed, or if the applications or storage stack in the guest
  transfer data properly (either through fsync operations or file system
  barriers), then data integrity can be ensured. However, because the host
  page cache is disabled, the read performance in the guest would not be as
  good as in the modes where the host page cache is enabled, such as
  writethrough mode.
* writethrough: writethrough mode is the default caching mode. With
  caching set to writethrough mode, the host page cache is enabled, but the
  disk write cache is disabled for the guest. Consequently, this caching mode
  ensures data integrity even if the applications and storage stack in the
  guest do not transfer data to permanent storage properly (either through
  fsync operations or file system barriers). Because the host page cache is
  enabled in this mode, the read performance for applications running in the
  guest is generally better. However, the write performance might be reduced
  because the disk write cache is disabled.
* writeback: With caching set to writeback mode, both the host page cache
  and the disk write cache are enabled for the guest. Because of this, the
  I/O performance for applications running in the guest is good, but the data
  is not protected in a power failure. As a result, this caching mode is
  recommended only for temporary data where potential data loss is not a
  concern.
* directsync: Like "writethrough", but it bypasses the host page cache.
* unsafe: Caching mode of unsafe ignores cache transfer operations
  completely. As its name implies, this caching mode should be used only for
  temporary data where data loss is not a concern. This mode can be useful for
  speeding up guest installations, but you should switch to another caching
  mode in production environments.
