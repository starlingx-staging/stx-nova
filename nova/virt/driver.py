    The interface to this class talks in terms of 'instances' (Amazon EC2 and
    internal Nova terminology), by which we mean 'running virtual machine'
    (XenAPI terminology) or domain (Xen or libvirt terminology).

    An instance has an ID, which is the identifier chosen by Nova to represent
    the instance further up the stack.  This is unfortunately also called a
    'name' elsewhere.  As far as this layer is concerned, 'instance ID' and
    'instance name' are synonyms.

    Note that the instance ID or name is not human-readable or
    customer-controlled -- it's an internal ID chosen by Nova.  At the
    nova.virt layer, instances do not have human-readable names at all -- such
    things are only known higher up the stack.

    Most virtualization platforms will also have their own identity schemes,
    to uniquely identify a VM or domain.  These IDs must stay internal to the
    platform-specific layer, and never escape the connection interface.  The
    platform-specific layer is responsible for keeping track of which instance
    ID maps to which platform-specific ID, and vice versa.

    Some methods here take an instance of nova.compute.service.Instance.  This
    is the data structure used by nova.compute to store details regarding an
    instance, and pass them into this layer.  This layer is responsible for
    translating that generic data structure into terms that are specific to the
    virtualization platform.

        this into consideration when provisioning networking for the instance.

        Mapping of MAC addresses to actual networks (or permitting them to be
        freeform) is up to the network implementation layer. For instance,
        with openflow switches, fixed MAC addresses can still be virtualized
        onto any L2 domain, with arbitrary VLANs etc, but regular switches
        require pre-configured MAC->network mappings that will match the
        actual configuration.

        Most hypervisors can use the default implementation which returns None.
        Hypervisors with MAC limits should return a set of MAC addresses, which
        will be supplied to the allocate_for_instance call by the compute
        manager, and it is up to that call to ensure that all assigned network
        details are compatible with the set of MAC addresses.

        This is called during spawn_instance by the compute manager.

        :return: None, or a set of MAC ids (e.g. set(['12:34:56:78:90:ab'])).
            None means 'no constraints', a set means 'these and only these
            MAC addresses'.
