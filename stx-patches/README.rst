StarlingX Patches
=================

These patch files form the basis of the single squashed commit released
with the publishing of the StarlingX source code.  These are the changes
made previously to the upstream OpenStack projects and represent the
original units of work.  They are likely to not be usable directly as
patch files due to the sanitization of information that is unreleasable
from the original code (customer references, internal work ticket references,
you know, stuff).

They are released here as documentation and reference for upstreaming work.
While the intent is for these to match the single large squashed commit
that is actually in the repo in reality there will be differences due to
at a minimum the different methods used for sanitizing the source code.
